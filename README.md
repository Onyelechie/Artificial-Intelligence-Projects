## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an ever-evolving field with the potential to solve complex problems and improve various aspects of our lives. This repository serves as a collection of AI projects, primarily centered around text sentiment analysis at the moment, with plans to expand and diversify the projects in the future.

## Projects

Currently, this repository hosts the following project:

1. **Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A sentiment analysis model that uses NLP techniques to determine the sentiment of text data, such as customer reviews or social media comments.

Expect more projects to be added in the future, covering a wide range of AI applications.

## Getting Started
